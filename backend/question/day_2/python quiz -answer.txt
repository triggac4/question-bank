1. Write a program which will count the "e" characters in the text 
"elacademy".
2. Create a script using a for loop to add all the integers between 0 and 30 
and display the total.
3. The Lagos state fishing club, which has 50 members, would like to 
record all the boats for their members and most important, record the
capacity of the boats in ton, to enable them rent them out properly.
Boats come in the following sizes, 55tons, 120tons and 28tons
You are to capture the names of the boats, phone number and size of 
each boat. Grade according to size


1. print("elacademy".count("e"))

2. sum=0
   for x in range(0,31):
   	sum+=x


3. def capture(size,numb,name):
   	if(size>=120):
        	grade="A"
   	elif(size>=55):
        	grade="B"
   	elif(size>=22):
        	grade="C"
   	else:
        	grade="D"

   	return {
        "size":size,
        "number":numb,
        "name":name,
        "grade":grade
    	}
  #loop though the members and call the function it returns a 
  #dictionary whichb you could add to a data collection like list..
  #list of dictionaries 
  print(capture(100,"09039388056","the ton"))
